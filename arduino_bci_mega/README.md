# Arduino Mega Code
Author: James Chen

This code should be uploaded to an arduino mega, and is will able to run all 
capabilities in code. This includeds SSVEP LED's, ultrasonic sensing, motor driving,
 bluetooth control. The arduino needs to be connected to the computer running python files
via either a serial cable connection or a HC-06 bluetooth module. 

 
***Note as of 22 July, 2020 code will not run motor control properly, setup to demonstrate
motor control with LED's. Will update as needed.
