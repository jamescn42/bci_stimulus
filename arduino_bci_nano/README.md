# Arduino Nano Code
Author: James Chen

This code should be uploaded to an arduino nano, with H-bridge output pins (4) at digital pins 
2, 3, 4, 5. The arduino should also have either a serial cable connection with the computer running
`control_methods.py` or have a HC-06 bluetooth module attached with rx/tx pins wired to digital pins
6 and 7.

Note this is not able to run SSVEP LED's, that can be done on a separate arduino.
